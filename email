Hi, could you send me an email to nycould@gmail.com? We have met an issue while using Tinode and would like to get some help. Our app is not using the traditional username/password login, instead, we used a method where a user uses "reset password" style to login everytime. We hope that once he signed in, he stay signed in forever. The problem we encouered however, is that user's token expires every a few minutes, kicking the user out. What can we do to make the user stay signed in forever? Thank you!
